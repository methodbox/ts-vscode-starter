## TypeScript VS Code Quickstart

This is just a quickstart for my VS Code config. Feel free to use.

#### Watch Mode Automatically

Just use `cmd + shift + B` and the compiler will automatically start in watch mode, no need to select or configure anything.

#### tsconfig

A basic tscofig is included. Edit to your heart's desire.
TypeScript is already integrated with VS Code, but is installed via `package.json` to support other featuers like `typescript-tslint-plugin` which replaces and improves on functionality originally provided by the `vscode-tslint` extension. Read more about it here: https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-tslint-plugin.

#### eslint

Eslint is included with default configuration. Install the `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` extension in VS Code.

#### Prettier

Meant to be used with Prettier. Just install the VS Code extension `esbenp.prettier-vscode`.
